            <p className="about-page__content">
                I am a London-based, Italian Software Engineer with a passion for <em><b>clean, minimalist design</b></em>.<br /><br />

                I fell in love with web design when I was just 12 years-old and I started building simple web pages using a software called <em>Microsoft FrontPage</em>.<br /><br />

                During my university years, I had little to no free time on my schedule, so I had to put web development aside. But since I moved to London in 2016, the urge to start coding again became stronger and stronger, until there was nothing else I could think about!<br /><br />

                Outside of work, I love watching films and tv shows, reading about design and tech, and chill out at home listening to music and cooking. I am really passionate about travelling and try to visit new places whenever I have the opportunity.<br /><br />
