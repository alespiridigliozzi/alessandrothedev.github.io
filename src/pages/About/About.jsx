            <p>Ciao! My name is Alessandro.

I am a London-based, Italian Software Engineer with a passion for clean, minimalist design.

I fell in love with web design when I was just 12 years-old and I started building simple web pages using a software called Microsoft FrontPage.

During my university years, I had little to no free time on my schedule, so I had to put web development aside. But since I moved to London in 2016, the urge to start coding again became stronger and stronger, until there was nothing else I could think about!

Outside of work, I love watching films and tv shows, reading about design and tech, and chill out at home listening to music or cooking. I am really passionate about travelling and try to travel whenever I have the opportunity (or budget!).
